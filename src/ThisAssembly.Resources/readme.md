This package generates a static `ThisAssembly.Resources` class with public 
properties exposing typed APIs to retrieve the contents of embedded resources.


```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="Content/Docs/License.md" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

Since markdown files are text files, the API will expose a `Text` property property 
for it that will read its content once and cache it:

The `$(EmbeddedResourceStringExtensions)` MSBuild property allows customizing which 
file extensions get treated as text files. By default, it's defined as:

```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <EmbeddedResourceStringExtensions>.txt|.cs|.sql|.json|.md</EmbeddedResourceStringExtensions>
  </PropertyGroup>
```

You can append additional file extensions to this list, or override it completely.
The list must be pipe-separated.

You can always use the provided `GetStream` and `GetBytes` for more advanced scenarios (or for 
non-text resources).

Optionally, you can specify the `Kind` metadata for a specific `EmbeddedResource` you want 
treated as a text file:

```xml
    <EmbeddedResource Include="query.kql" Kind="Text" />
```

You can also add a `Comment` item metadata attribute, which will be used as the `<summary>` XML 
doc for the generated member.

Set the `$(ThisAssemblyNamespace)` MSBuild property to set the root namespace of the 
generated `ThisAssembly` class. Otherwise, it will be generated in the global namespace.
