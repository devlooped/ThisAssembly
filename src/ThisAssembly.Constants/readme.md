This package generates a static `ThisAssembly.Constants` class with public
constants for `@(Constant)` MSBuild items in the project.

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <Constant Include="Foo.Bar" Value="Baz" Comment="Yay!" />
    <Constant Include="Foo.Hello" Value="World" Comment="Comments make everything better 😍" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

In addition to arbitrary constants via `<Constant ...>`, it's quite useful (in particular in test projects) 
to generate constants for files in the project, so there's also a shorthand for those:

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <FileConstant Include="@(Content)" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

Which results in:

Set the `$(ThisAssemblyNamespace)` MSBuild property to set the root namespace of the 
generated `ThisAssembly` class. Otherwise, it will be generated in the global namespace.
